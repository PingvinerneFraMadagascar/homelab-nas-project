# Project Overview

This project documents the end-to-end setup of a homelab NAS using a UGREEN
DXP 4800 Plus. The goal is to create a secure, flexible environment suitable
for learning system administration, networking, and cybersecurity concepts.

The system is intentionally designed to balance performance, reliability,
and simplicity, while remaining suitable for a home environment.

This documentation focuses not only on what was configured, but why
specific design decisions were made, including trade-offs and alternatives.
